# ‚öΩ Player Re-Identification in a Single Feed

This project implements a **player detection and re-identification system** using a YOLO object detection model on a single video feed.  
It detects players, assigns unique IDs based on their initial appearance, and tracks them across frames ‚Äî maintaining the same IDs even when players temporarily leave and re-enter the frame.

## üìΩÔ∏è Objective

Given a short video:
- Detect players in each frame.
- Assign each detected player a unique ID.
- If a player leaves the frame and returns later, recognize and reassign the same ID.
- Simulate real-time player tracking by generating an annotated output video with bounding boxes and IDs.

## üìñ How It Works

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Player Detection**
- Uses a YOLO model (via the Ultralytics library) to detect players in each video frame.
- Returns bounding boxes and class confidences for detected players.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **ID Assignment**
- In the first few frames, assigns a unique numeric ID to each detected player.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Re-Identification Logic**
- Uses **IoU (Intersection over Union)** to compare each new detection's bounding box to previously tracked players' bounding boxes.
- If the IoU between a new detection and an existing player's last known position exceeds a defined similarity threshold (default 0.85), the same ID is assigned.
- If no match is found, a new ID is created for the player.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Output Video Generation**
- Draws bounding boxes and player IDs on each video frame.
- Combines these frames into an annotated output video and saves it at `output/output_annotated.mp4`.

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Python
Ensure Python 3.8 or later is installed on your system. You can download it from:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Required Python Libraries

Install the necessary libraries listed in `requirements.txt` by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Contents of requirements.txt:
opencv-python
ultralytics
scikit-learn
numpy

 3Ô∏è‚É£ Prepare Files
Place your input video inside the videos/ directory.
Example: videos/15sec_input_720p.mp4

Place your YOLO model file inside the model/ directory.
Example: model/yolo_model.pt
(Note: Since this file is large ‚Äî around 186 MB ‚Äî it isn't stored on GitHub. Download it separately if needed.)


4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Program
In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project directory and run:

python main.py
